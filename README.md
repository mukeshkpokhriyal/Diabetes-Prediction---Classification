# Diabetes-Prediction---Classification
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the onset of diabetes using a dataset with 8 independent variables and one categorical outcome variable representing the presence or absence of diabetes.
# The project involves the following steps:

1.	Data Loading and Preprocessing: Load the diabetes dataset and perform
    necessary preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding         categorical features, and feature scaling.
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the data to understand the             distribution of features, relationships between features, and identify          potential patterns related to diabetes.
3.	Model Selection and Training: Train different machine learning models for       classification tasks, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree                Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and Support Vector Machines.
4.	Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of trained models using metrics      like accuracy, cross-validation, confusion matrix. Select the best              performing model based on the evaluation results.
